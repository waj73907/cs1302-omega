## Part 1: App Description

My app is called Catch-Up and what it allows is for any formula one fan
to query a database from every Formula One race since 1950 and see the
final standings. If the year of your race is after 2017, the program will
link the user to the official highlight video on the formula one youtube
page.


## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I gained a much more experience with GUIs and since that has been the
aspect that I have wanted to know since day 1, the extra comfort when
working with them is very nice.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start over then I would start earlier so I could figure out
how to embed the video in the program instead of relying on it linking
to the video. I just couldnt get the webView object to work in my program.
